# Lack-of-Fusion Prediction (LoF-Pred)

This repository provides an online application for predicting **lack-of-fusion (LoF) defects** in Laser Powder Bed Fusion (LPBF).  
The tool uses a geometric model based on melt pool depth and width, layer thickness, hatch distance, and rotation angle.  
It is implemented in **Streamlit** and freely accessible to the community.
